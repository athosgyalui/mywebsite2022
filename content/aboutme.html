<p>Hi, I am Athos. I was born in France but am half Argentinian and half Armenian. I completed my undergraduate degree in Civil Engineering and now study Analytics and Management at London Business School. My only coding experience has been on MATLAB but I am starting to familiarise myself with R. Some of my work completed in the past weeks is available on this website, along with my CV and contact details.</p>
