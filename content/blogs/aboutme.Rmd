## Personal life
Hi, I am Athos. I was born in France but am half Argentinian and half Armenian. I have been living in the UK for the past 6 years and plan on finding a job here. 

## Academics
I completed my undergraduate degree in **Civil Engineering** at *Imperial College London*. However, as my ambition is to have a leading role in a company, I want to strengthen my knowledge of business management. I have a particular interest in the use of data to help businesses strive, which is why I am now completing a **Masters in Analytics and Management**. I study at *London Business School* and will complete my programme in 2023.

## Interests
Aside from studies, I have a passion for travelling. I therefore try to go as far as I can when given the opportunity so that I can learn about new cultures. I am also a big boxing fan, which I also practice regularly.
