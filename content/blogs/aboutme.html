<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>I completed my undergraduate degree in <strong>Civil Engineering</strong> at <em>Imperial College London</em>. However, as my ambition is to have a leading role in a company, I want to strengthen my knowledge of business management. I have a particular interest in the use of data to help businesses strive, which is why I am now completing a <strong>Masters in Analytics and Management</strong>. I study at <em>London Business School</em> and will complete my programme in 2023.

<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>Aside from studies, I have a passion for travelling. I therefore try to go as far as I can when given the opportunity so that I can learn about new cultures. I am also a big boxing fan, which I also practice regularly.</p>
